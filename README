NAME
    Tie::RegexpHash - Use regular expressions as hash keys

REQUIREMENTS
    "Tie::RegexpHash" is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0, but should
    run with Perl 5.005. (Because it uses Regexp variables it cannot run on
    earlier versions of Perl.)

    It uses only standard modules.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RegexpHash;

      my %hash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RegexpHash';

      $hash{ qr/^5(\s+|-)?gal(\.|lons?)?/i } = '5-GAL';

      $hash{'5 gal'};     # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5GAL'};      # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5  gallon'}; # also returns "5-GAL"

      my $rehash = Tie::RegexpHash->new();

      $rehash->add( qr/\d+(\.\d+)?/, "contains a number" );
      $rehash->add( qr/s$/,          "ends with an \`s\'" );

      $rehash->match( "foo 123" );  # returns "contains a number"
      $rehash->match( "examples" ); # returns "ends with an `s'"

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows one to use regular expressions for hash keys, so that
    values can be associated with anything that matches the key.

    Hashes can be operated on using the standard tied hash interface in
    Perl, or using an object-orineted interface described below.

    A more detailed description can be found in the POD

SEE ALSO
    "Tie::Hash::Regex" is a module with a complimentary function. Rather
    than a hash with Regexps as keys that match a fetch, this module has
    standard keys but uses Regexps for fetches.
