NAME
    Tie::RegexpHash - Use regular expressions as hash keys

REQUIREMENTS
    Tie::RegexpHash is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0, but should run
    with Perl 5.005. (Because it uses Regexp variables it cannot run on
    earlier versions of Perl.)

    It uses only standard modules. Serialization is supported through
    Storable, but Storable is not required for normal operation.

  Installation

    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use `nmake' instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RegexpHash;

      my %hash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RegexpHash';

      $hash{ qr/^5(\s+|-)?gal(\.|lons?)?/i } = '5-GAL';

      $hash{'5 gal'};     # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5GAL'};      # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5  gallon'}; # also returns "5-GAL"

      my $rehash = Tie::RegexpHash->new();

      $rehash->add( qr/\d+(\.\d+)?/, "contains a number" );
      $rehash->add( qr/s$/,          "ends with an \`s\'" );

      $rehash->match( "foo 123" );  # returns "contains a number"
      $rehash->match( "examples" ); # returns "ends with an `s'"

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows one to use regular expressions for hash keys, so that
    values can be associated with anything that matches the key.

    Hashes can be operated on using the standard tied hash interface in
    Perl, or using an object-oriented interface described below.

SEE ALSO
    Tie::Hash::Regex is a module with a complimentary function. Rather than
    a hash with Regexps as keys that match against fetches, it has standard
    keys that are matched by Regexps in fetches.

    Regexp::Match::Any matches many Regexps against a variable.

    Regexp::Match::List is similar, but supports callbacks and various
    optimizations.
