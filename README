NAME
    Tie::RegexpHash - Use regular expressions as hash keys

REQUIREMENTS
    `Tie::RegexpHash' is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0. A future
    version might be tweaked to run on 5.005.

    It uses only standard modules.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

    No test suite is available in this version.

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RegexpHash;

      my %hash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RegexpHash';

      $hash{ qr/^5(\s+|-)?gal(\.|lons?)?/i } = '5-GAL';

      $hash{'5 gal'};     # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5GAL'};      # returns "5-GAL"
      $hash{'5  gallon'}; # also returns "5-GAL"

      my $rehash = Tie::RegexpHash->new();

      $rehash->add( qr/\d+(\.\d+)?/, "contains a number" );
      $rehash->add( qr/s$/,          "ends with an \`s\'" );

      $rehash->match( "foo 123" );  # returns "contains a number"
      $rehash->match( "examples" ); # returns "ends with an `s'"

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows one to use regular expressions for hash keys, so that
    values can be associated with anything that matches the key.

    Hashes can be operated on using the standard tied hash interface in
    Perl, or using an object-orineted interface described.

    More detailed documentation is described in the module's POD.
